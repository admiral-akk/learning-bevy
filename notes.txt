So I want to be able to declare a button, in-line. This is a problem because:

- The button is a component (data)
- The button's behaviour is a system (transformations)
- The motivation for ECS is that you seperate out the data and transformations on the data

Solution:

- Make a beefy button object, with every parameter you could care about
- Make a generic system to handle it
